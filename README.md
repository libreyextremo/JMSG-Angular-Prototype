# 🧠 Framework Angular vs ReactJS
I chose Angular for the following reasons::
• Clear structure and organization:
Angular enforces a clear architecture (modules, components, services, routing, etc.), so I don’t waste time deciding how to organize the project.
• Ready to use CLI:
The Angular CLI lets you create, build, serve, test, and generate code fastly and easily.
Everything included out of the box
• Angular built-in tools:
Angular comes with built-in tools for Routing, HTTP Client, Testing (Jasmine/Karma), SCSS support and Dependency injection.
In React, most of these require installing and configuring external libraries (React Router, Axios, Jest, etc.).
• Fewer decisions, faster development
React gives you freedom, but that also means more setup decisions (state management, router, styling, folder structure...).
Angular defines most of that for you, allowing faster progress when time is limited.
